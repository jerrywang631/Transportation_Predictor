# Responsive TTC Transit App

This project is a TTC transit prototype with:

- Vite/React frontend
- Express API server
- local TTC GTFS SQLite database for stops and scheduled arrivals
- OpenTripPlanner 2.8 for real walking, driving, biking, and TTC routing
- Google Maps Directions API support for real GTA/GTHA cross-agency routing when configured
- live place search through a geocoder for arbitrary destinations

## Current Features

- **TTC map and stop exploration**: shows nearby TTC stops on an interactive map, highlights the selected stop, and supports switching route directions.
- **Arrival prediction and delay explanation**: estimates TTC arrivals from GTFS data and explains schedule, weather, traffic, accidents, construction, events, holidays, and other delay offsets.
- **Destination search and recommendations**: supports AI-style search for TTC stops, addresses, landmarks, tourist attractions, restaurants, parks, and shopping destinations. The search page also shows location-aware recommendations and recent search history.
- **Trip planning and navigation**: supports destination routing by transit, walking, driving, and biking through OpenTripPlanner when available, with route steps, ETA, destination pins, and map centering for selected destinations.
- **Account and memory support**: users can sign up, log in, log out, and keep recent search history locally for faster repeated searches.
- **Milk bot transit assistant**: answers TTC questions about arrivals, stops, route delays, nearby options, traffic, weather, construction, events, holidays, crowding, route terminals, and navigation.
- **Trip-planning chatbot support**: understands natural language trip requests such as planning a trip tomorrow to a destination, keeps destination context for follow-up questions, and uses Gemini for intent classification and answer verification when configured.
- **Toronto guide chatbot support**: answers broad Toronto itinerary and recommendation questions, including attractions, food, restaurants, parks, shopping, rainy-day plans, family-friendly ideas, budget plans, and follow-up adjustments.
- **Multilingual chatbot responses**: replies in the user's language for English, Chinese, and French questions, and formats longer answers with readable line breaks and numbered lists.
- **Events and holidays awareness**: considers Toronto sports games, concerts, large entertainment events, Ontario/Canadian public holidays, and holiday greetings when answering questions or explaining prediction factors.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm
- Java 21+ for OpenTripPlanner

Install dependencies once:

```bash
npm install
```

Create your local env file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows PowerShell, use:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

## Data Files

The app expects local data under `data/`.

Current expected files:

```text
data/
  gtfs.sqlite
  source/
    Complete GTFS.zip
  otp/
    otp-shaded-2.8.1.jar
    ttc.gtfs.zip
    toronto.osm.pbf
  construction/
    Road-reconstruction-program.geojson
```

If `data/gtfs.sqlite` is missing but the GTFS zip is available, build it with:

```bash
npm run setup:data
```

Large database/data files are local runtime assets and may not be committed to Git.

## Environment

Important `.env` values:

```env
PORT=3001
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash
GTFS_DB_PATH=./data/gtfs.sqlite
TTC_GTFS_RT_TRIP_UPDATES_URL=https://gtfsrt.ttc.ca/trips/update?format=text
OTP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
OTP_PLAN_DATETIME=match-weekday
OTP_GTFS_SERVICE_START_DATE=2026-06-21
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=optional_google_maps_directions_api_key_for_gta_routing
TICKETMASTER_API_KEY=optional_ticketmaster_discovery_api_key
TOMTOM_API_KEY=optional_tomtom_traffic_api_key
```

`GEMINI_API_KEY` is used only by the Express API server for chatbot intent classification and answer verification/correction. Do not put this key in a `VITE_` variable, because Vite exposes those values to the browser bundle.

`OTP_PLAN_DATETIME=match-weekday` maps the current clock time to the same weekday inside the GTFS feed calendar. This avoids failed transit searches when today's real date is outside the downloaded TTC feed's service dates.

`TTC_GTFS_RT_TRIP_UPDATES_URL` enables real TTC GTFS-Realtime trip updates. Arrival predictions use this feed first when it contains a matching route and stop, then fall back to static GTFS schedules when live data is unavailable.

`GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` enables real cross-GTA/GTHA trip planning through Google Maps Directions API, including transit trips that combine GO Transit, TTC, Oakville Transit, MiWay, YRT/Viva, Brampton Transit, Durham Region Transit, HSR, walking, driving, and biking where Google has provider coverage. Enable Directions API for the key in Google Cloud and attach billing. Without this key, the app can only use your local OTP graph; for GTHA routing without Google, build OTP with complete GTFS feeds for the relevant agencies.

`TICKETMASTER_API_KEY` enables live Toronto sports, concert, festival, and entertainment event lookups through the Ticketmaster Discovery API. If it is not set, the app falls back to local major-venue pressure estimates for Toronto.

`TOMTOM_API_KEY` enables live Toronto traffic flow and incident lookups through the TomTom Traffic API. The prediction algorithm uses live road speed, free-flow speed, road closure, accident, congestion, and roadwork signals when available. If it is not set or the API request fails, the app falls back to the local time-of-day, route-demand, and downtown-pressure traffic estimate.

Holiday awareness uses the public Nager.Date holiday API for Canadian/Ontario public holidays. If that request fails, the app falls back to a small local set of fixed-date Ontario holidays.

Restart `npm run server` after changing `.env`.

## Start OpenTripPlanner

Open a terminal from the project root and run:

```bash
java -Xmx4G -jar ./data/otp/otp-shaded-2.8.1.jar --build --serve ./data/otp
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
java -Xmx4G -jar .\data\otp\otp-shaded-2.8.1.jar --build --serve .\data\otp
```

Keep this terminal running. OTP is ready when you see a log line like:

```text
Grizzly server running
```

The Express API calls OTP at:

```text
http://localhost:8080/otp/gtfs/v1
```

If OTP is not running, navigation routes return `Navigation unavailable.`

## Start The App

Use three terminals:

1. OpenTripPlanner:

```bash
java -Xmx4G -jar ./data/otp/otp-shaded-2.8.1.jar --build --serve ./data/otp
```

2. Express API:

```bash
npm run server
```

3. Vite frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For local network testing:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

Then open the Vite URL shown in the frontend terminal, usually:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

## Common Issues

- Search or navigation changes do not show up: restart `npm run server`.
- OTP says no transit route: confirm the Java OTP terminal is still running on port `8080`.
- Transit only works on one date: keep `OTP_PLAN_DATETIME=match-weekday`.
- Browser location does not show: allow location permission for the local site in the browser.
- Arbitrary destination search needs network access because it uses an online geocoder.
